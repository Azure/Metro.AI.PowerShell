## <a name="development"></a> Development Guidelines

### Adding New Functions

When adding new functionality to the module, follow these guidelines:

#### Public Functions (User-Facing)
1. Create a new `.ps1` file in the `/src/Public/` directory
2. Use the `Verb-MetroAI[Noun]` naming convention
3. Include proper PowerShell help documentation using comment-based help
4. Add the function name to the `FunctionsToExport` array in `Metro.AI.psd1` if it's not using wildcards

#### Private Functions (Internal Helpers)
1. Create a new `.ps1` file in the `/src/Private/` directory
2. Use descriptive names that clearly indicate internal use
3. These functions are automatically loaded but not exported to users

#### Classes
1. Add new classes to the `/src/Classes/` directory
2. Use one class per file
3. Follow PowerShell class naming conventions

### Function Template

Use this template when creating new public functions:

```powershell
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Brief description of what the function does.

.DESCRIPTION
    Detailed description of the function's purpose and behavior.

.PARAMETER ParameterName
    Description of the parameter.

.EXAMPLE
    Example-Command -Parameter Value
    Description of what this example does.

.NOTES
    Any additional notes about the function.
#>
function Verb-MetroAINoun {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [string]$ParameterName
    )

    # Function implementation
}
```

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a pull request:

1. Import the module locally to test your changes:
   ```powershell
   Import-Module ./src/Metro.AI.psd1 -Force
   ```

2. Verify that your new functions are available:
   ```powershell
   Get-Command -Module Metro.AI
   ```

3. Test your function's functionality thoroughly

### MCP Server Configuration

When working with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, note that the current implementation only supports servers with `require_approval = 'never'`. Examples and documentation should reflect this limitation.

### Code Style Guidelines

- Follow PowerShell best practices and naming conventions
- Use approved PowerShell verbs (Get-Verb for a list)
- Include proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Use Write-Verbose for detailed logging
- Use Write-Warning for non-fatal issues
- Use Write-Error for errors that should be reported

## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue.
Help us to maximize the effort we can spend fixing issues and adding new
features, by not reporting duplicate issues.  Providing the following information will increase the
chances of your issue being dealt with quickly:

- **Overview of the Issue** - if an error is being thrown a non-minified stack trace helps
- **Version** - what version is affected (e.g. 0.1.2)
- **Motivation for or Use Case** - explain what are you trying to do and why the current behavior is a bug for you
- **Browsers and Operating System** - is this a problem with all browsers?
- **Reproduce the Error** - provide a live example or an unambiguous set of steps
- **Related Issues** - has a similar issue been reported before?
- **Suggest a Fix** - if you can't fix the bug yourself, perhaps you can point to what might be
  causing the problem (line of code or commit)

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

Before you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:

- Search the repository (<<https://github.com/azure/metro.ai.powershell>) for an open or closed PR
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.

- Make your changes in a new git fork:

- Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message
- Push your fork to GitHub:
- In GitHub, create a pull request
- If we suggest changes then:
  - Make the required updates.
  - Rebase your fork and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!
